        <p>Manufacturing being an engine of a countryâ€™s economy, it is essential that the manufacturing processes minimize waste and reduce the environmental impact for sustainable development. Effluents from manufacturing processes are the second most reason for the pollution and global warming. The mission aims at developing technologies and processes that minimize the consumption of toxic materials in all manufacturing technologies. The mission also focuses on maximum utilization of renewable energy resources, converting waste into sustainable energy and develop products/methods to minimize hazardous wastes.</p>
